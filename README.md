Hello. I am a mostly-freelance UI engineer with old-school proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and new-school opinions on front-end development. My specialties include civic technology, open data, and digital mapping, and I almost always work in open source. In a previous life, I worked in architecture and urban design, and I continue to lean on my background and experience there to navigate the murky ethics of technology today. You can contact me for collaboration opportunities if you also believe that all technology work is inherently political (as opposed to apolitical), and in the redistribution of wealth and power.

I strongly believe in upholding a healthy work-life balance, and for me, that includes video games, shitposting about video games, travel, photography, and snowboarding.
