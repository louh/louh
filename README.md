## Iceland

There's nothing more picturesque than snow, rocks, and a sign of a fish on a stick. Just look at it, basking in the glow of Iceland's never-ending twilight. Well, I guess it ends at some point. I didn't stick around long enough to find out. Protip: bring snacks.

## Dublin, Ireland

Don't make the same mistake I did: don't fat-finger "Ireland" into your phone when you're trying to get to Reykjavik, only to get off the plane one international flight later and realize everyone still speaks English. Still, you can't say no to the free baskets of Jameson whiskey on literally every corner of town, and it's just another one of those reasons why other countries have superior healthcare systems compared to "global south"-type countries like the United States.

# Never Asked Questions (NAQ)

I'm writing these based on the template GitHub gave me. No one has ever actually asked them.

### What are you currently working on?

After some thought<sup name="note-1">[1](./#user-content-superscript-1)</sup>, I've realized the answer ‚Äî the _real_ answer! ‚Äî is myself. I'm always working on myself. Some other artifacts may manifest in that process, but ultimately they're in service of helping me be the ~~best~~ latest version of myself I can be. Eh, what's the "best" version of anything? The ecosystem is always changing. You can only hope that the patches keep up.

### What are you currently learning?

Patience.

### What are you looking to collaborate on?

Shit that matters. Look, the bar is so low on this. You literally need to walk into a project and say "maybe this doesn't scale but it'll be meaningful to the people who use it" and I'm on board. The surprising thing is _how rarely this actually happens._

### What are you looking for help on?

Everything. Make my life easier and that makes you a god. An actual diety. Again, you won't believe how rare this is. Most people offer to help and make things more complicated in the process.

### Can I ask you about something?

Yes.

### How do I reach you?

Find a mutual friend, then have them introduce you to me at a party. It can't be a one-on-one situation, those are awkward, one that I reserve for the greatest of friends. We need to be at a social gathering, that is not at my house or an office, with other people, music, booze, and snacks. None of those features are more important than the other, they're just signifiers that qualify the setting as an appropriate venue. Then, proceed with your comment or query. P.S. do not e-mail me unless you are okay with a reply in two to six business weeks. P.P.S. do not DM me on a social media platform<sup name="note-2">[2](/#user-content-superscript-2)</sup>.

### What are your pronouns?

he/him

### What's a fun fact about you?

I've got twelve fingers.


#### Footnotes

- <span name="superscript-1">[1](./#user-content-note-1).</span> By some I mean I sat in a cave for seventeen years to arrive at the answer.
- <span name="superscript-2">[2](./#user-content-note-2).</span> Unless you want a bullshit answer written by my social media manager, who is an idiot.
