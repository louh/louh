### üëãüèº Hi! I'm Lou.

You may remember me from my work with **[Streetmix](https://github.com/streetmix/)**, **[Bad Idea Factory](https://github.com/badideafactory/)**, **[Mapzen](https://github.com/mapzen/)** or  **[Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica/)**.

I am a UI engineer with old-school proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and new-school opinions on front-end development. My specialties include civic technology, design, and digital mapping, and I almost always work in open source. In a previous life, I worked in architecture and urban design, and I continue to lean on my background and experience there to navigate the murky ethics of technology today.

You can [contact me](mailto:lou@louhuang.com) for collaboration opportunities if you also believe that all technology work is inherently political (as opposed to apolitical), and in the redistribution of wealth and power in the service of equity for all.


## A work-in-progress collection of screenshots from ongoing projects

Here's an overview of some fairly recent personal and professional projects I like. (Note: this is a WIP, I'll gradually add more when I get around to it.) Links will go to code repositories because if you're on GitHub you might be interested in how I write and organize code. Links to deployments will be present on each repository page.

## The last word of this page

I strongly believe in upholding a healthy work-life balance, and for me, that includes video games, travel, photography, and snowboarding. Here's a photo from Iceland.
