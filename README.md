### üëãüèº Hi! I'm Lou.

You may remember me from my work with **[Streetmix](https://github.com/streetmix/)**, **[Bad Idea Factory](https://github.com/badideafactory/)**, **[Mapzen](https://github.com/mapzen/)** or  **[Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica/)**.

I am a UI engineer with old-school proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and new-school opinions on front-end development. My specialties include civic technology, design, and digital mapping, and I almost always work in open source. In a previous life, I worked in architecture and urban design, and I continue to lean on my background and experience there to navigate the murky ethics of technology today.

You can [contact me](mailto:lou@louhuang.com) for collaboration opportunities if you also believe that all technology work is inherently political (as opposed to apolitical), and in the redistribution of wealth and power in the service of equity for all.


## A collection of screenshots from projects

Here's an overview of some fairly recent personal and professional projects I like to show off. Links will go to code repositories because if you're on GitHub you might be interested in how I write and organize code. Links to deployments will be present on each repository page.

**[LCARS](https://github.com/louh/lcars)** is the fictional user interface from Star Trek that I've recreated in the browser.

**[Vision 2020: Seat at the Table](https://github.com/badideafactory/vision2020)** commemorates the 100th anniversary of the women‚Äôs right to vote with an interactive history exhibit at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center.

**[Scriptchat](https://github.com/badideafactory/scriptchat)** turns Slack transcripts into screenplays.


## Miscellaneous things

New York City's **[MTA subway bullets](https://github.com/louh/mta-subway-bullets)** don't have consistent styling, for some reason. So I made my own.

I've been playing around with Linux. I made dotfiles but more importantly I made a graphic for **[my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/louh/dotfiles)** that I'm somehow more proud of than learning Linux.

## The last word of this page

I strongly believe in upholding a healthy work-life balance, and for me, that includes video games, travel, photography, and snowboarding. Here's a photo from Iceland! üòé
